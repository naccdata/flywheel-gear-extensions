# CSV to JSON Transformer

Gear reads a tabular (CSV) file where each row has a NACCID and creates a JSON file for each row

The JSON file will be added to a subject/session/acquisition for the participant determined by the NACCID. 

The labels for session and the file name are determined by the config input `hierarchy_labels`, which is an an object with template strings for each:

```json
{
    "session": {
        "template": "<template-text>",
        "transform": "<transform-name>"
    },
    "acquisition": {
        "template": "<template-text>",
        "transform": "<transform-name>"
    },
    "filename": {
        "template": "<template-text>",
        "transform": "<transform-name>"
    }
}
```

templates must be given for each of `session`, `acquisition`, and `filename`.

A template can reference the fields in the file by preceding the field name with a dollar sign.
For instance, the NACCID in the row could be included as `$naccid`
Reference the base of the original file name with `$filename` (e.g., for a file `base.csv` the value would be `base`).

Supported transforms are converting the whole label to upper or lower case.
So, the allowed values are `upper` and `lower`.

As an example, suppose we are splitting biomarker data from a data release designated `2024-12`.
Also, the data was collected with an assay designated `assay-01`, and we want to use the original filename except in lower case.

```json
{
    "session": {
        "template": "biomarker-release-2024-12"
    },
    "acquisition": {
        "template": "assay-01"
    },
    "filename": {
        "template": "$filename",
        "transform" "lower"
    }
}
```

Here the first two don't have variables, and the last uses the filename.


### Environment
This gear uses the AWS SSM parameter store, and expects that AWS credentials are available in environment variables (AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION) within the Flywheel runtime.

### Inputs
This gear will be triggered on the CSV file generated by  the [Identifier Lookup](../identifier_lookup/index.md) gear.

### Configs
Gear configs are defined in [manifest.json](../../gear/csv_subject_splitter/src/docker/manifest.json).
