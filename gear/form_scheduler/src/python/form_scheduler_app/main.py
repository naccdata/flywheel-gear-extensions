"""Defines the Form Scheduler.

1. Pull and queue the tagged files for each pipeline by module sorted by file timestamp
2. Pipelines are processed in the order they are listed in the pipeline configs file
   For each pipeline, process the module subqueues
3. Modules are processed in the order they are listed in pipeline configs
   Move to next module subqueue,
    a. Check whether there are any pipeline gears running/pending;
       if so, wait for them to finish
    b. Pull the next file from the subqueue and clear queue tags
    c. Trigger the starting gear for the pipeline on the pulled file
    d. Wait for the triggered pipeline to finish
    e. Send email to user that the submission pipeline is complete
    f. Repeat 3a - 3e until current subqueue is empty
   Repeat 3a - 3e until all subqueues are empty for the current pipeline
4. Move to next pipeline, and repeat 3)
5. Repeat from the beginning until there are no more files to be queued
